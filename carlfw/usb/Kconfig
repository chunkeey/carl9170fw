	def_bool y
	prompt "Basic USB Interface"
	help
	 Allows the device to be queried about Standard USB 2.0 Device
	 Description Descriptors.

	 Say Y, unless you don't care if lsusb -v fails.

config CARL9170FW_USB_UP_STREAM
	def_bool y
	prompt "USB Upload Stream"
	help
	 This features allows the USB silicon to combine small, single
	 frames into bigger transfers. This can help to reduce
	 some per-transfer overhead in the application.

	 Say Y, unless you have experienced strange rx corruptions.

config CARL9170FW_USB_DN_STREAM
	def_bool n
	prompt "USB Download Stream"

config CARL9170FW_DEBUG_USB
	def_bool y
	prompt "Pass debug messages through USB transport"
	help
	 Report all firmware messages through the USB transport.
	 But there is a catch: In case of a BUG, the USB transport
	 needs to be functional, otherwise the application won't
	 receive anything.

	 Say Y.
